# Crystal-Ball #

Crystal Ball is a Web Based user interface that queries server data and displays data on the webpage. 

## How it works ##

The Apache server used in this project has data stored in the database. This project uses queries to retrieve server information based on server attributes. 

** 'prearchiver02-02.usw', 'Java', '4.5.2', '2015-06-07' **

This server information is stored on the server side and is queried based on the user input into the search bar on the homescreen.
